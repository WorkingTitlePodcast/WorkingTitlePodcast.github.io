Matt and Emily discuss mail in voting and absentee ballots – how do you do it? Why should you do it? Where can I do? Is it safe to do it? Basically, Matt has a lot of questions and Emily is going to try to talk slow and answer most of them.
## Shownotes

**Here is a transcript of an email Matt sent to the Orange County Supervisor of Elections, regarding the treatment of absentee ballots.**

_Hello, I am seeking information about how absentee ballots are counted in Florida. I have seen some sources indicate that absentee ballots are counted differently from a vote collected at a polling place, in that absentee ballots are only opened and counted if the race is close enough to justify. I have seen some news sites say this isn’t true, but I can’t find it actually written anywhere that seems legitimate. Are absentee ballots counted only under certain circumstances? Or are they counted equally with regular ballots filled in person at a polling place? Thank you very much for your time._

_Matthew Winchester_

Dear Mr. Winchester:
 
_Thanks for your email. Absentee (Vote-by-Mail) ballots are counted the same as voting at the polls or early voting._  

_When you vote early or at the polls, your ID and signature are verified when you receive your ballot. With the Vote-by-Mail ballot, the voter signs the certificate on the back of the envelope containing their ballot. Trained staff match the envelope signature with the signature on file on the voter’s record. If the signature is matched, it is accepted for tabulation. If the signature is different or missing, the voter is notified and provided an affidavit to “cure” the signature issue._

_I’m attaching a link to the Florida Division of Elections you may find helpful on voting by mail. https://dos.myflorida.com/elections/for-voters/voting/vote-by-mail/._

_Sincerely,_
_Christine Rebuck_
