<h2>About "The Working Title Podcast"</h2>
<p>
    Emily and Matt have been talking about doing a podcast for what seems like a really long time. Emily’s favorite thing to do is talk and Matt’s favorite thing to do is debate. 
    Considering their ideological differences, you can imagine how their conversations often go. But to Matt and Emily, the fact that they had and keep having conversations about politically charged topics is the most important part. 
    The pair started dating in November of 2016 … so they’ve had a lot to talk about from the beginning. And they have managed to do so civilly, kindly and still get into bed with each other at the end of the day. Something they noticed other people seemed to struggle with. Every time you get on Facebook, watch the news or gather around the family table for dinner you can watch conversations devolve into nasty arguments with name calling, insult trading and subsequent unfriending. 
    And while it would be impossible to agree with everyone all the time, about everything – Matt and Emily at least thought people should be able to have civil conversations. 
    So that’s what this podcast is, an attempt by Matt and Emily to have civil conversations focused on a wide range of political topics. Cause if they can do it, so can you! 
    They can’t promise the conversations will be filled with agreements, smiles and butterflies. But they can promise to be on their best behavior, be respectful of one another and to share it with you. So here goes nothing!!

<h2>About Emily</h2>

<p>
    Emily is a graduate student currently pursuing a dual degree in nonprofit management and public administration. She works as a graduate assistant in University of Central Florida’s Office of Multicultural Academic & Support Services.
    Emily is originally from the panhandle of Florida, specifically from Panama City, most well known for being a very popular spring break destination. She can confirm that they have the best beaches in Florida, but only when the tourists aren’t in town. Emily moved to Orlando in 2016 and started at UCF as a transfer student working towards a bachelor’s degree in Political Science. She graduated in 2017 after spending a semester interning in Washington D.C. with a Human Rights Group. 
    In December of that year Emily and Matt got married and they’ve been in central Florida every sense. 
    When Emily’s not working or studying, she really enjoys playing board games, taking naps and reading political books.  Emily loves flamingos, carbs, Disney World, donuts and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (RIP). Emily also likes being involved with various student organizations and professional associations – like too involved. Matt regularly has to talk her out of adding more things to her plate. How will this podcast fit into her busy schedule? She has no idea, but hopes you enjoy it!!

<h2>About Matt</h2>

<p>
    Matt likes to code, and had a lot of fun making this website and learning the basics of making a podcast. Matt knows there's still a lot to do, and looks forward to recording cool stuff with his wife.
    Matt graduated from UCF in 2018 with a degree in Computer Science, and works as a Software Engineer. 
    While a man of fewer words than his wife, Matt hopes this podcast will be useful to those who listen and help get factual information to those who need it.
